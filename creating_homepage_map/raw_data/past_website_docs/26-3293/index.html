Portland Clean Air Oregon DEQ Permits and Reports for Basic Type 03 for ID 26-3293
</h1>
<p>Basic emitters are the least significant air pollution emitters tracked by Oregon DEQ.
<p>All permit types can be found on <a href="http://www.deq.state.or.us/aq/permit/acdp/basic.htm">The Oregon DEQ Website</a>.</p>
<p>Files with aqb and three digits are the base permit application.  A file with aqrb and three digits is the annual reporting form.</p>
<p>Basic ACDP permits are governed by <a href="http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/rules/oars_300/oar_340/340_tofc.html">OAR 340 Division 200 to 268</a> and no specific permits are issued.</p>
<p>Basic emitters have not had their applications scanned yet, so we provide only copies of the forms they would have filled out.</p>
