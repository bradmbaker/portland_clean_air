Portland Clean Air Oregon DEQ Permits and Reports for General Type 07 for ID 34-2636
</h1>
<p>General reports and permits are issued to an entire industry and individual emitters are added to the general report associated with their industry type.</p>
<p>All permit types can be found on <a href="http://www.deq.state.or.us/aq/permit/acdp/general.htm">The Oregon DEQ Website</a>.</p>
<p>Permits with aqgp and three digits are the base permit.  An <q>a</q> suffix is the permit attachment, if available.  An <q>r</q> suffix is the permit assessment report.  An <q>a</q> prefix is the permit application form.  A <q>r</q> prefix is the annual reporting form.</p>
<p>General emitters have not had their applications scanned yet, so we provide only copies of the forms they would have filled out.</p>
