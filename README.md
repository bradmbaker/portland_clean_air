# portland_clean_air

This is repo has some projects I've done for the data behind Portland Clean Air.


### Directories
The `clean_emissions_data` is a directory that takes emissions data from DEQ and puts it into an easiely digestible format. This data is sometimes referred to as DEQ CAO data.

The `creating_homepage_map` directory is the process of collecting data and cleaning it for the map on the homepage of the website.
